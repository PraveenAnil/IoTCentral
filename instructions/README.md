# Azure Immersion Workshop: IoT Central

Lab time: 90 minutes

Azure IoT Central is a solution development platform that simplifies IoT device connectivity, configuration, and management. The platform significantly reduces the burden and costs of IoT device management, operations, and related developments. Customers & partners can build an end to end enterprise solutions to achieve a digital feedback loop in logistics. 

Choosing to build with Azure IoT Central gives an opportunity to focus your time, money, and energy on transforming your business with IoT data, rather than just building the solution from the ground up. maintaining, and updating a complex system and continually evolving IoT infrastructure.

## Lab context

Azure IoT Central enables the easy monitoring and management of a fleet of remote devices for logistics operations.

Azure IoT Central encompasses a range of underlying technologies that work great, but can be complicated to implement when many technologies are needed. These technologies include Azure IoT Hub, the Azure Device Provisioning System (DPS), Azure Maps, Azure Time Series Insights, Azure IoT Edge, and others. It's only necessary to use these technologies directly, if more granularity is needed than available through IoT Central.

In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy IoT Central Application Templates to rapdily build enterprise-grade IoT applications on a secure, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that optimize supply chains, improve experiences for customers, and track inventory more efficiently.


## Exercise 1 - Getting Started with Azure IoT Central

This exercise will cover how to get started with the existing IoT Central Connected logistics application template available in IoT Central for Asset Tracking Scenario

## Exercise 2 - Customizing IoT Central Application

This exercise will cover how to add custom branding and operator resources to an Azure IoT Central application with white labeling options for a better visual fit with an organizationâ€™s other applications

## Exercise 3 -	Connect IoT Plug and Play Certified Devices

In this exercise, you will see how to connect an IoT Plug and play certified devices from the device catalog to your existing IoT Central Application

## Exercise 4 -	IoT Central Openness and Integrations

In this exercise, you will see the openness and the integration capabilities of IoT Central
